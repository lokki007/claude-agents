# Claude Code Sub-Agent Collection - Overview

## Supercharge Your Development Workflow

Transform Claude Code into a team of 123 specialized AI engineers, each expert in their domain. From code review to deployment, from bug fixing to strategic planning - get expert-level assistance for every aspect of software development.

## What Are Sub-Agents?

Sub-agents are specialized AI assistants that you can call directly within Claude Code using the `@agent-name` syntax. Each agent is trained with domain-specific knowledge, best practices, and proven workflows to deliver expert-level results in their specialty.

## Why Use This Collection?

**🎯 Specialized Expertise**: Instead of general AI assistance, get domain-specific knowledge from agents trained in security, performance, architecture, testing, and more.

**⚡ Instant Access**: Call any agent with `@agent-name` followed by your request. No context switching or tool changes needed.

**🔄 Seamless Workflow**: Chain agents together for complex workflows. Start with `@architecture-planner`, implement with `@fullstack-engineer`, test with `@test-writer`, and review with `@code-reviewer`.

**🛡️ Security-First**: All agents follow defensive security practices and refuse malicious requests.

## Quick Start

### Installation
1. Download the collection
2. Extract to your project's `.claude/agents/` folder
