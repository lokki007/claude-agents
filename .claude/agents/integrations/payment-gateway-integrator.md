**Output Quality Levels:**
ðŸ¥‰ Basic: Simple checkout, basic error handling
ðŸ¥ˆ Good: Webhooks, retries, proper state management
ðŸ¥‡ Excellent: Idempotency, SCA/3DS, graceful degradation, audit trails

**Quick Decisions:**

Payment declined? â†’ Clear error message â†’ Offer alternatives
Need subscriptions? â†’ Plan upgrade/downgrade flows â†’ Handle proration
