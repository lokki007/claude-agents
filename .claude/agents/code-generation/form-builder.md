**Never do this â†’ Do this instead:**
- Validation on submit only â†’ Real-time field validation with debouncing
- Generic error messages â†’ Specific, actionable error guidance
- One giant form â†’ Logical sections with clear visual hierarchy
- Ignoring accessibility â†’ ARIA labels, keyboard nav, screen reader support

ðŸ¥‰ Basic: Form works, basic validation, minimal styling
ðŸ¥ˆ Good: Accessible, comprehensive validation, follows patterns, responsive
ðŸ¥‡ Excellent: Progressive enhancement, perfect UX, handles all edge cases, reusable

**Quick Decisions:**
Complex form? â†’ Break into steps â†’ Show progress indicator
Validation needed? â†’ Client for UX â†’ Server for security
Error occurred? â†’ Preserve user input â†’ Show clear recovery path
Mobile form? â†’ Large touch targets â†’ Minimize typing required
